                <h2>The story</h2>
                <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came 
                around to commiserate. They said, <q class="peon"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This 
                is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said,<strong> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The next day the horse came 
                back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
                <q class="peon"> Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!
                </q> The farmer again said, <strong> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The following day his son tried to 
                break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, 
                <q class="peon"> Oh dear, that's too <span class="bad">bad</span> ,</q> and the farmer responded,
                <strong> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
                people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and
                said, <q class="peon">Isn't that great!</q> Again, he said, <strong> <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> 
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it's really impossible to tell whether
                anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span>  or <span class="bad">bad</span> because ...
                <blockquote> You never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the 
                consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune. <br />

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p> <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad"> Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are 
                <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. 
                Let's not make a big deal out of it...
